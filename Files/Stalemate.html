    <p> <em>Stalemate</em> is a particular type of Draw. It occurs when the player who is to move has no legal move but isnâ€™t in Check. According to the chess rules, a stalemate ends the game with a draw.
	<p>
    <p> For example, if the king is NOT in Check, but can no piece can be moved without putting the king in Check, the game will end with a stalemate draw. So the first thing to understand about Stalemates is that they look much like Checkmates. But with one significant difference: The King is not in Check!
	<p>
	<p> Key Points:	
	<ul>
	<li> Stalemate is a tie game. Also known as a Draw.
	<li> Three ways to stalemate: defective material (not enough firepower), no legal moves, and three-fold repetition. 
	<li> If you're winning, nothing is fun about a stalemate.
	<li> Fighting back to a draw is one of the best chess feelings if you lose.
	</ul>
	<p> 
	<p> There are several ways to avoid ending a game in a stalemate position:
	<ul>
	<li> Understand the stalemate rule. A stalemate occurs when players can only legally move to a safe square, not when they have only one or two trapped pieces.
	<li> Observe your opponent. 
	<li> Give your opponent room to move.
	<li> Avoid focusing on other pieces.
	</ul>
