    <p> The Queen (&#9813, &#9819) is the most powerful piece on the board. A Queen can often be used with a Knight, Bishop, Rook, or Pawn to create checkmate opportunities. Because of its mobility, the Queen is also an excellent piece for using tactics such as forks, pins, skewers, and double attacks, especially late in the game against the enemy king.
    <p>
    <p> The queen can be moved any number of unoccupied squares in a straight line vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, thus combining the moves of the rook and bishop. The queen captures by occupying the square on which an enemy piece sits.
    <p>
	<p> Queen Strategies
	<p> • The Queen is too important of a piece to lose early in the game. It is generally a good idea to bring out your Queen once you have already developed a few pieces. “Queen Raids” often work well on beginning players. But against better, more experienced players, bringing the Queen out early will give your opponent an easy target.
	<p> • Check to see if your Queen is being attacked after every move. Yes, it is that important!
	<p> • Queens work best on open files and diagonals, similar to Rooks and Bishops.
	<p> • Queens work best when coordinating an attack with other pieces.
	<p> • Don’t send your Queen to the opponent’s end of the board without support.
	<p> • If your opponent brings their Queen out early, attack it.
