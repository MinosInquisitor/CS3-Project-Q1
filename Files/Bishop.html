		<p> Bishops (&#9815, &#9821) are long-range pieces that should place on long open diagonals. Unlike the knight, the bishop doesn't necessarily need an outpost in the center of the board - it can exert influence on the center from the edge. The best position for a bishop is one where it commands an open diagonal, and enemy pawns or knights cannot attack.
		<p> 
		<p> They are most potent in open positions, meaning pawns do not block the center of the board. However, one of the bishop's negatives is that a bishop must remain in one color. As a result, the bishop can sometimes render the bishop relatively useless in certain endgames. For example, the two knights were no match for the two bishops on an open board!
		<p> 
		<p> Bishop Strategies
		<p> • Bishops excel in open positions. If you have a bishop versus a knight, trade as many pieces as possible, except the bishop of course.
		<p> • Bishops need to be placed on diagonals that are not blocked to be effective.
		<p> • The value of the bishop tends to increase over the value of a Knight as more pieces are removed from the board.
		<p> • Having a pair of bishops versus two knights is generally an advantage.
		<p> • As most pieces, the bishop is most powerful in the center of the board.
