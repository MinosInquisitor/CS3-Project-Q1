    <p> <em>Castling</em> is a special move to protect your king and activate your rook. It's the only time you can move two pieces in one motion in chess. The king moves two squares to the right or left, and the rook moves directly to the king's other side. You can only castle if both the rook nor king has advanced and no pieces are in the way. You can also not cast when in check, into, or through check. 
	<p>    
	<p> Castling is primarily about getting your king safe because the move usually takes your most important piece out of the center of the board and tucks him away behind a wall of pawns.
	<p>
	<p>Castling can only happen if all of the following conditions are met in a game:
	<ul>
	<li>The king has not previously moved;
	<li>Your chosen rook has not previously moved;
	<li>There must be no pieces between the king and the chosen rook;
	<li>The king is not currently in check;
	<li>Your king must not pass through a square that is under attack by enemy pieces;
	<li>The king must stay in check.
	</ul>
