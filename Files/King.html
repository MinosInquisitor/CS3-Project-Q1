    <p> The king (&#9812, &#9818) is the most critical piece to protect on the chessboard. But also remember that the king can capture details, help defend essential squares, and even be helpful in certain attacking situations. So knowing when to tuck your king away in a safe corner or when to bring the king into the middle of the action can become significant in tight games.
    <p>
    <p> The main reason the king is weak is that it would be harder to deliver checkmate on a mighty king. Therefore, the game would be much slower than it is today. This is why the game was designed only to allow the king to move in any direction, one square at a time.
    <p>
    <p>King Strategies
    <p>• It is generally wise to castle your king early in the game to get the king away from the center of the board where most of the action will take place.
    <p>• If you don’t have any rooks protecting your back rank, be careful that your castled king doesn’t end up in a ‘smother’ mate.
    <p>• Try to castle to a side of the board where the three end pawns have not moved (unless you fianchettoed a bishop). After castling, try to keep the pawn cover for the king intact. Only move pawns that are protecting the king forward if necessary.
    <p>• When most pieces are removed from the board, and the game enters the endgame phase, start bringing your king toward the middle of the board. Kings are strongest in the middle of the board in the endgame.
