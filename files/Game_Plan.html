    <p> Strategy in chess is essentially placing your pieces in the optimal position to create a static, or long-term, advantage. Things we learned such as minimizing the number of pawn islands, placing bishops on open diagonals, creating advanced support points for knights, placing rooks on half-open and open files, and castling your king early in the game can give you a nice long-term advantage in your chess games when done correctly. 
	<p>    
	<p> Endgame Principles
	<ul>
	<li> If you are up in material, trade pieces to simplify the game.
	<li> If you are behind in material, donâ€™t trade pieces, if possible, and try forcing a stalemate.
	<li> Move your king toward the center of the board and use it as another attacking piece. The king finally gets to display his power.
	<li> The king will often be needed to help force checkmates.
	<li> Trap the enemy king toward the sides and corners of the board.
	<li> Use your king to escort pawns to promotion squares. Your King should be in front of your pawns to promote.
	<li> Minimum material required to force a mate: king and queen vs. king, king and rook vs. king, two bishops and king vs. king, and bishop, knight and king vs. king. Interestingly enough, two knights and a king cannot force a checkmate.
	<li> You have 50 moves without advancing a pawn or capturing a piece to force checkmate.
	<li> If the same identical position is repeated three times, the game is a draw.
	</ul>
