        <p> En passant is a move that captures a pawn that has moved two squares forward. 
        <p> The rule only permits the turn of the opponent pawn that has moved and cannot have a move 
	<p> later. It also means “in passing” in English.
	<p>
	<p> It is one of the last rules added to chess during the late 19th century.
	<p> An example of an “En Passant” checkmate:
