  	<p> Tactics are dynamic moves that are made to take advantage of a short-term situation.
	<p> <em>The fork</em> is a move where a piece or a pawn attacks two pieces at the same time. Forks are often associated with knights, but in fact, every chess piece, including the pawn, is capable of forking other pieces. Forking an enemy king and with another piece is the most effective type of fork because the king will be in check and will be forced to move, leaving the other piece to be captured.
	<p>
	<p> <em>Discovered attacks</em> are created when a piece is moved and a piece lying behind the piece that moves attacks an enemy piece. Think of it as an ambush. Discovered attacks are extremely effective against queens, rooks, and kings.
	<p>
	<p> A <em>pin</em> occurs when a piece is attacked an cannot move because if it moves a more valuable piece behind it will be taken. An absolute pin, the most effective form of the pin, occurs when a piece cannot move because if it moves the king will be in check, which of course, is illegal. When you have pinned an opponentâ€™s piece, attack the pinned piece. If you have a pinned piece, break the pin as soon as possible.
