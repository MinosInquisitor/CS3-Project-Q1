    <p> The knight (&#9816, &#9822) is a piece in the game of chess represented by a horse's head and neck. It may move two squares vertically, one square horizontally, and one square vertically, jumping over other pieces. Knights capture enemy pieces by replacing them on their square.
    <p> 
	<p> Knights are slow, so they can only move slowly from one side of the board to the other. As a result, knights are vulnerable to threats from pawns, and pawns can quickly drive knights back (unless the knight finds a safe square that a pawn can't attack.)
	<p> 
	<p> Unlike a bishop, a knight is often not as good in an endgame. A knight can only exert control over one part of the board at a time and usually takes multiple moves to reposition to a new location, which often makes it less suitable in endgames with pawns on both sides of the board.
