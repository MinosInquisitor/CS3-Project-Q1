    <p> The rooks (&#9814, &#9820) are compelling chess pieces, especially in the endgame when few details remain on the board. Unfortunately, beginners often need to remember to bring their rooks into play during the heat of battle because of their awkward starting positions at the edge of the board. Checkmating with a rook only works at the edge of the board. Your king helps to drive the opposing one to the edge and offers support in the mating pattern.
    <p> 
    <p> Rook Strategies
    <p> • First and foremost, don’t forget about your rooks. Then, somehow, get your rooks into the action, preferably on the d and e files.
    <p> • Place your rooks on open files or half-open files.
    <p> • Doubling rooks on open files can provide an excellent ‘battering ram’ to break through formidable defenses.
    <p> • Try to get two rooks on the 7th rank. Two rooks on the 7th rank are known as ‘pigs’ because they often gobble up opposing pawns and pieces.
    <p> • Use a rook to trap the enemy king against the side of the board.
    <p> • Placing a rook on the same file as your opponent’s Queen or King can be very useful when preparing an attack. Unfortunately, this often leads to pins and discovered attacks.
